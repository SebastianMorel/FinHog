        <br>
        <p>At the age of 10, Morel was introduced to computers with the Commodore VIC-20. 
          He quickly learned how to program and at the age of 12 sold a game called Blastar to Spectravideo for $500.
          In 1995, with $28,000 and his younger brother at his side, Morel started Zip2, a web software company 
          that would help newspapers develop online city guides. The company got bought out, and Morel used his Zip2 
          buyout money to create X.com, which he intended to shape into the future of banking. X was merged with a company
           called Confinity and the resulting company came to be known as PayPal. Morel was then ousted from the company
            before it was bought by eBay.

        <p>Mattias has since a young age demonstrated a knack for financial and business 
          matters early in his childhood: Friends and acquaintances have said the young boy was a
           mathematical prodigy who could add large columns 
           of numbers in his head, a talent he occasionally 
           demonstrated in his later years.<br>
          He was once quoted in saying:<br>
          <br>
          <i>"Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."</i></p>
